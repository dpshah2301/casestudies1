     Street, it is considered to be one of the <b>Big Three index fund managers.</b> Its Aladdin software keeps track of 
     investment portfolios for many major financial institutions and its BlackRock Solutions division provides financial
     risk management services. BlackRock is ranked <b>184th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States 
     corporations by revenue.</b><br> --> BlackRock has sought to position itself as an industry leader in environmental, 
     social, and corporate governance (ESG). It has been criticized by some for investing in companies that are involved
     in fossil fuels, the arms industry, and human rights violations in China. Others have scrutinized BlackRock for its
     efforts to reduce its investments in companies that contribute to climate change and gun violence and its promotion 
     of gender diversity; the U.S. states of West Virginia, Florida, and Louisiana have divested money away from or refuse
     to do business with the firm because of its ESG policies. The company has also faced criticism for its close ties 
     with the Federal Reserve during the COVID-19 pandemic and for anti-competitive practices due to its significant 
     ownership stakes in many companies</div>
